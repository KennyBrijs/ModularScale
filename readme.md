## Compose your type to a scale

ModularScale is an scss file to make composing your type to a scale easy. It's just an automation of [Tim Brownsâ€™ (@nicewebtype)](https://twitter.com/nicewebtype) [Modular Scale](http://modularscale.com/), so be sure to [check out his presentation on the matter](http://vimeo.com/17079380) to really grasp what it's about (it just takes thirty minutes, and it's really worth it!).

### Workflow

1. Import the file

2. Set your body copy font-size in the `$font-size` variable (default is 16)

3. Choose a scale by setting te `$scale` variable to `$perfect-fourth` | `$perfect-fifth` | `$golden-section` (default is `$perfect-fifth`, `$perfect-fourth` are more subtle increments in size, `$golden-section` are more drastic increments.)

4. Set your type using the `$xxs` to `$xxxxxl` variables (e.g. `body{font-size: $s + px}`) (`$s` is the one for your body copy)

	1. `$xxs`
	2. `$xs`
	3. `$s`
	4. `$m`
	5. `$l`
	6. `$xl`
	7. `$xxl`
	8. `$xxxl`
	9. `$xxxxl`
	10. `$xxxxxl`

Currently you still have to add ` + px` after the variable, a mixin that will automatically set type with `rem` values *and* a px fallback is coming **very very** soon.
